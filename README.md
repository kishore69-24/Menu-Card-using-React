This project is a React-based Recipe Menu Card application. It displays a collection of recipe cards, each showing the recipe name, preparation and cook times, details (servings, difficulty, type), and an image. The design includes a blue and purple gradient background, modern card layouts, and smooth hover effects for an engaging user experience. It's ideal for learning React concepts like props, component composition, and CSS styling.
